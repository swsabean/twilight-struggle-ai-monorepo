## Overview

In the complex board game of Twilight Struggle, making optimal decisions is crucial. This module employs a combination of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), neural networks, and other techniques to evaluate game states and determine the best moves for the AI player.

## Features

- **State Evaluation**: Analyzes the current game state to determine the AI's position.
- **Move Prediction**: Uses trained models to predict potential moves.
- **MCTS Integration**: Employs MCTS for exploring possible game outcomes and selecting optimal moves.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Docker installed.
2. **Building the Container**:
   ```
   docker build -t ai-decision-making .
   ```
3. **Running the Container**
   ```
   docker run -p 8081:8081 ai-decision-making
   ```


## Algorithms and Techniques

- **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**: A heuristic search algorithm used for decision-making in the game.
- **Neural Networks**: Trained models that assist in evaluating game states and predicting moves.
- [Any other algorithms or techniques you plan to use]

## Development
