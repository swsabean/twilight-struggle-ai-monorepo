## Overview

In the complex board game of Twilight Struggle, making optimal decisions is crucial. This module employs a combination of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), neural networks, and other techniques to evaluate game states and determine the best moves for the AI player.

## Features

- **State Evaluation**: Analyzes the current game state to determine the AI's position.
- **Move Prediction**: Uses trained models to predict potential moves.
- **MCTS Integration**: Employs MCTS for exploring possible game outcomes and selecting optimal moves.
