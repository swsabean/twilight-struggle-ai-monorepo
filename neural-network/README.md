## Overview

This module contains the neural network models that are central to the AI's decision-making process. These models are trained on game data to evaluate board states and suggest potential moves.

## Features

- **State Evaluation**: Uses trained neural networks to evaluate the desirability of a given game state.
- **Move Prediction**: Predicts the likely moves that a player would make in a given game state.
- **Model Management**: Handles the saving, loading, and updating of trained models.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Docker installed.
2. **Building the Container**:
   ```
   docker build -t neural-network .
   ```
3. **Running the Container**:
   ```
   docker run -p 8082:8082 neural-network
   ```

## Model Architecture

- **Input Layer**: Represents the game state, e.g., board positions, player scores, etc.
- **Hidden Layers**: [Description of the hidden layers, activation functions, etc.]
- **Output Layer**: Represents the predicted move or evaluation of the game state.

## Training the Model

1. **Data Preparation**: [Description of how to prepare and format the training data]
2. **Training Process**: [Training command, e.g., train_model.py] 
3. **Model Evaluation**: [Description of how to evaluate the trained model]

## Development

- **Environment**: [Any specific environment variables or configurations]
- **Dependencies**: [List of key libraries or services the module depends on]

## Testing

1. Navigate to the `tests` directory.
2. Run the test suite using: [Testing command, e.g., pytest]
