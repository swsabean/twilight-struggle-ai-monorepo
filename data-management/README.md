## Overview

Efficient data management is crucial for the performance and scalability of the Twilight Struggle AI system. This module provides the necessary tools and infrastructure to manage vast amounts of game data and AI models.

## Features

- **Game Data Storage**: Stores game states, moves, and outcomes.
- **Training Data Management**: Handles the storage and retrieval of data used for training the neural networks.
- **AI Model Management**: Manages the storage, retrieval, and versioning of trained AI models.
- **Database Operations**: Provides APIs for CRUD operations on the data.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Docker installed.
2. **Building the Container**:
   ```
   docker build -t data-management .
   ```
3. **Running the Container**
   ```
   docker run -p 8083:8083 data-management
   ```


## Database Structure

- **Game Data Table**: Contains columns for game state, moves, outcomes, etc.
- **Training Data Table**: Stores data samples used for training, including input states and expected outputs.
- **AI Models Table**: Holds metadata about AI models, including version, training date, performance metrics, etc.

## Development

- **Environment**: [Any specific environment variables or configurations]
- **Dependencies**: [List of key libraries or services the module depends on, e.g., database drivers, ORM libraries, etc.]

## Testing

1. Navigate to the `tests` directory.
2. Run the test suite using: [Testing command, e.g., pytest]
